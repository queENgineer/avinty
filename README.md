The API has to have for the following list:
- (GET) localhost:8085/API/V1/employees
  o Gives back all of the records of the table.
- (GET) localhost:8085/API/V1/dep-emp
  o Gives back every department with the connected employees.
- (GET) localhost:8085/API/V1/department?name=?
  o Filter departments based on name. The data is used in a drop-down, so
  the whole entity is not required.
- (POST) localhost:8085/API/V1/employees
  o Creates an employee.
- (DELETE) localhosts:8085/API/V1/department/:id
  o Deletes a department based on ID. Set Null to every connected employeeâ€™s
  DEP_ID field.
  We are working with Rest API, so every communication must be done in JSON structure
  between the API and the client.
